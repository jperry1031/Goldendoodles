            <h1>About the Breeders</h1>
			   
            <p class="aboutgd2"> 
			    We are located in rural Virginia Beach.  We live on over 6 1/2 acres of land so our dogs and puppies get plenty of 
				fresh air and exercise. We all enjoy lots of nature and many beautiful sunsets.
				​<br><br>
                Over 25 years we have occasionally bred our own personal dogs including; Bouviers, Corgis, Dobermans, and
				<br> Golden Retrievers.  After raising our two boys with Dobermans, we discovered Standard Poodles.  We loved their
				<br> intelligence, agility, and non-shedding.  After some diligent research, we discovered GOLDENDOODLES.
                <br><br>
​                We began breeding Goldendoodles in 2003.  We kept a Goldendoodle from our first breeding. <br> She is the famous….Shenleigh O’Doodle!  She has become an ambassador for the breed! <br><br> We have established ourselves a top reputation for producing smart, happy, healthy,<br> well-structured dogs with great temperaments and intelligence.  We earned the distinction <br>of being listed as recommended breeders at the worldwide website Goldendoodles.com.

            <h1>All About Goldendoodles</h1>
			   
            <div class="aboutgd4">  
			    A Goldendoodle is a hybrid cross between a Golden Retriever and a Standard Poodle.  
				<br>They are a fantastic mix of two amazing and intelligent dog breeds.  
				<br>They are the perfect dog for many reasons:
				<br><br>
				<ul>
				    <li>
					    They are very intelligent. The Standard Poodle is #2 on the dog smart scale & 
					    
					    the Golden Retriever is #4. 
					</li>
					<br>
					<li> 
					    They LOVE people as they were originally bred to be therapy dogs.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li> 
					    They are very easy to train as they want to please you.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li> 
					    They have a gorgeous coat ranging from curly to wavy. They look like shaggy 
						
						retrievers!<br> The coat is very low shedding and has no dander so you don’t get 
						
						the “wet dog” smell and they do well with people with allergies.
					</li>
				</ul>
