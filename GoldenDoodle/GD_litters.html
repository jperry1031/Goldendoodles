            <h1>Litter Announcements!</h1>
			<p>
			<div>
			    We are excited to announce some updated breeding plans for our Summer 2020 litters!!
                <br>				
				Be sure to visit parents page to view moms and dads.
                <h3>3/31/2020 Update:</h3> 
				-At this time all of the puppies that we have now have deposits placed on them.
				<br>
                - We are planning an F1 and an F1b litter bred in April and ready for families 
				early <br>summer. We are taking deposits on these litters.
				<br>
                *We will be breeding this week so check back to see who the parents will be :)
				<br><br>
				
				<hr style="width: 80%; height: 1px; background-color: white; border-color: white;">
                <br>
				
				Our puppies are amazing and they will melt your heart!
                <br><br>
				
				Puppies are selected in deposit order, at our home, when they reach 4 weeks old.
                <br>
				We then keep the puppies an additional 3-4 weeks to work with them on housebreaking, litter training, 
				<br>
				and socialization. We also provide tips and hints to help with training, and acclimating your puppy into your life.
                <br><br>
				
                Deposits on a puppy are $200. Typically there are 8 puppies per litter, although it is not uncommon to have more.
                <br>
				Many times after the puppies are born more become available. 
				<br><br>
				
				We are more than glad to help you select your puppy and will share our knowledge of temperaments, coats, etc...
                <br>
				after all everyone is looking for something different in a puppy!!
                <br><br>
				
                Many of our puppies have gone on to to be service and therapy dogs, and of course, amazing family pets. 
				<br>
				It's common that after a family falls in love with their first VA beach goldendoodle, they come back for another!
                <br><br>
				
                Our goldendoodles are standard in size so typically our females are 55-ish pounds and our males are 65-ish pounds.
                <br><br>
				
                We have a Facebook group you can join by clicking on the Blue Facebook F on our website. 
				<br>
				There you can see pictures of puppies from our past litters and see what people are saying about us.
                <br><br>
				
                Again, dates are approximated as mother nature is in chargeâ€¦ Please let us know if you have any questions.
                <br><br>
				
                Thank you,
				<br><br>
